# Whack-A-Rat
![screenshot](assets/images/logo.png)

Welcome to Whack-a-Rat, a classic game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! The objective of the game is to whack as many rats as possible in 60 seconds, while avoiding the mice that pop up among them. It's a simple yet addictive game that's suitable for players of all ages.

Whack-a-Rat is a fun and challenging way to pass the time. Whether you're looking for a quick break or a longer gaming session, Whack-a-Rat is the perfect choice. With its responsive design, you can play Whack-a-Rat on your desktop, laptop, or mobile device.

## UX
The Whack-A-Rat Game has been designed to provide an enjoyable and engaging user experience.
The game features a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, When using a Desktop or laptop the mouse is used to whack the animals, On a mobile device the animals are whacked using the touch pad. The gameplay rules and controls are straightforward, allowing all ages to quickly understand the game.

### Colour Scheme
I chose bright yet soft tones to keep the user's eye engaged throughout the game. I intentionally avoided using pink or blue as I wanted the game to be appealing to all sexes. Instead, I opted for a combination of bright and engaging colors that would be attractive to both younger and older players.

I believe that the color scheme of a game can have a significant impact on the user's experience, so I wanted to make sure that the colors I chose were not only visually appealing but also easy on the eyes. By using a combination of bright and soft tones, I was able to create a color scheme that was both fun and engaging, while still being comfortable to look at for extended periods of time.

I used [Design shack](https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/website-design-for-kids-tips-and-advice/) for my colour theme research.

- `#8CFF90` used for text Background.
- `#D3FF8F` used for Game play area.
- `#8CD61A` used for Navigation bar and Button text.
- `#B46EFF` used for Text Background.
- `#AD00D7` used for Button.

I used [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography
I used [Design shack](https://designshack.net/articles/graphics/website-design-for-kids-tips-and-advice/) To research typography.

 I chose to use only sans-serif fonts. The reason for this is that sans-serif fonts are very clear and easy to read, which is important for younger children with less reading ability, as well as for older children and adults who may not be at the expected reading level.

By using a sans-serif font, I was able to ensure that all text in the game was clear and easy to read, regardless of the user's age or reading ability.

I believe that the typography of Whack-a-Rat is an important aspect of the game's design, as it ensures that all users are able to easily read and understand the instructions and scoring system.
