    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the exciting world of Whack-a-Rat! In this fast-paced game, you'll be challenged to use 
        your quick reflexes and keen eye to whack as many rats as you can in just 60 seconds. But watch out for
         the sneaky mice hiding among the rodents, because if you accidentally whack one, you'll lose a point!</p>

    <p>Your goal in Whack-a-Rat is to score as many points as possible by whacking rats with your mouse or touchpad.
         Each time you successfully hit a rat, you'll earn one point. But be careful not to hit any mice, because 
         each time you do, you'll lose a point. The game lasts for 60 seconds, so try to rack up as many points as 
         you can before time runs out!</p>

         <p>The rats and mice will pop up randomly from the compost bins throughout the game. Keep your eyes peeled 
            and your reflexes sharp! Keep in mind that both rats and mice will pop up at different intervals and 
            locations, so be ready to move your mouse or touchpad quickly to whack them before they disappear.</p>

        <p>To maximize your score in Whack-a-Rat, try to focus on hitting the rats first and foremost. They're worth
             more points and are easier to hit. If you do accidentally hit a mouse, don't panic! Just keep your cool
              and stay focused on the rats. And remember, speed is key in this game, so try to move your mouse or
               touchpad as quickly and accurately as possible.</p>

        <p>Are you ready to take on the challenge of Whack-a-Rat? Then let's get started! See if you can beat your high
             score with each new game, and challenge your friends and family to see who can rack up the most points. Good 
             luck, and happy whacking!</p>
